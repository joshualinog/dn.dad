Schema integration
===================

This project vendors the D&D 5e JSON Schemas (from Brian Wendt) under the `schemas/` directory.

What I added:
- `schemas/` — vendored JSON Schema files (Character, Creature, Weapon, Dice, etc.)
- `scripts/convert-and-validate-all-characters.js` — converts all character files in `src/_data/characters/` (excluding `*.schema.json`) into schema-compliant JSON files and validates them using `ajv`.
- `src/_data/characters/*.schema.json` — outputs generated by the above script (schema-compliant).
- `package.json` script: `npm run validate:characters` to run the conversion/validation for all characters.

Notes: The script will exit with a non-zero code if any character fails validation and prints details to the console.

How to use:
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run the converter + validator: `npm run validate:characters`
3. Inspect the generated file at `src/_data/characters/dahg.schema.json`.

Notes:
- The conversion script is intentionally conservative: it creates a schema-compliant **export** and does not overwrite the original `dahg.json`.
- The repository now includes a GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/validate-characters.yml`) that automatically runs `npm run validate:characters` on `push` and `pull_request` when character files, schemas, and related scripts change. The workflow will fail the run if any character fails validation, helping catch schema drift early.
