# Backgrounds — Hidden Light of the Moon

This directory documents custom backgrounds used in the campaign.

- File: backgrounds/hidden-light-of-the-moon.md — full lore and mechanics for the Hidden Light of the Moon custom background.
- Usage: Players can choose this background to reflect membership in a secret, noble society of women defenders tied to lunar themes. The GM should approve the presence of the society in the campaign and decide how often Hidden Refuge favors are available in different settlements.

Notes:
- The background grants Performance and Insight proficiencies (or optional Persuasion/Deception), proficiency with a disguise kit and the harp, one language, and two small features (Hidden Refuge and Moonlit Persona). All narrative benefits should be coordinated with the GM.
