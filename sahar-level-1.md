## Class Features (added at Level 2)
- Cunning Action: Beginning at 2nd level, Sahar can use a bonus action on each of her turns in combat to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

Important bonus-action note: Sahar's Astral Elf racial Starlight Step is also a bonus action (teleport up to 30 feet). Because both Starlight Step and Cunning Action use your bonus action, you generally cannot use both in the same turn. Plan whether you need instant teleportation (Starlight Step) or repeated tactical movement/stealth (Cunning Action) in a given round.

## Skills
Proficiencies (from Rogue + background):
- Performance +3 (Cha + prof)
- Insight +2 (Wis + prof)
- Investigation +5 (Int + prof)
- Perception +2 (Wis + prof; Keen Senses racial)
- Sleight of Hand +7 (Dex + expertise)
- Stealth +7 (Dex + expertise)

Expertise chosen:
- Stealth (expertise)
- Sleight of Hand (expertise)

## Racial Features (Astral Elf)
- Keen Senses: proficiency in Perception
- Fey Ancestry: advantage vs. charm; immune to magical sleep
- Astral Fire: one cantrip
- Starlight Step: teleport up to 30 ft as a bonus action; uses = proficiency bonus (2 per long rest)
- Astral Trance: need only 4 hours for a long rest

## Equipment
- Armor: Leather armor
- Weapons: Rapier (recommended when available), 2 daggers, light crossbow
- Tools: Disguise kit, Harp, Thieves' tools
- Pack: Burglar's pack
- Starting gold: (unchanged)
- Society trinket: a slim silver pin stamped with a crescent and a tiny hidden mirror

Recommended purchases at Level 2 (prioritize):
1. Studded leather armor (AC boost)
2. Rapier (if not already equipped)
3. Extra disguise kit supplies, change-of-clothes sets, forged papers
4. Tools to care for rescued children (blankets, coin to pay an innkeeper, medicine)

## Tactics & Role
- Role: Mobile skirmisher and covert operative; Level 2 solidifies Sahar's ability to hide or disengage as a bonus action and better control the fight.
- Typical combos:
  - Hit-and-run: Attack with Sneak Attack, bonus action: Cunning Action → Hide, vanish into cover.
  - Teleport-escape: Attack, bonus action: Starlight Step to teleport out; accept that you forgo Cunning Action that round.
  - Disengage retreat: Attack, Cunning Action → Disengage, move through dangerous terrain without provoking opportunity attacks.

## Roleplay Hooks & Training Beats
- Training milestone: Sahar completes a Hidden Light exercise: she performs a public harp set while listening for whispers of abuse and arranging a rescue behind the scenes.
- Moonlit Persona practice: Use your Moonlit Persona feature in a low-risk mission to test and refine a new cover identity.
- New responsibility: Sister Imane assigns Sahar a small extraction: retrieve a ledger from a steward's chest and escort a widow's child to a safehouse.

## Leveling Notes
- Level 3: Arcane Trickster — plan cantrips: Mage Hand (required), Minor Illusion, and an offensive or utility cantrip (Booming Blade or Prestidigitation). 1st-level spells: Find Familiar (owl), Silent Image, Disguise Self (or Charm Person).
- Level 4: ASI / Feat
