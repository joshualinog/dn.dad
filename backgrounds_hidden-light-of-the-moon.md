# Hidden Light of the Moon — Moonlit Operative (Custom Background)

Lore / Flavor
- The Hidden Light of the Moon is a secret society of noble women devoted to defending women and children from oppression, abuse, and neglect. Outwardly they are patrons, landholders, performers, or court attendants; inwardly they train as covert operatives.
- Their philosophy is lunar: like the moon they can be bright and open (full moon), adopt phases to hide or reveal parts of themselves, or disappear entirely (new moon). They rely on disguise, stagecraft, careful social positioning, and clandestine tradecraft to protect the vulnerable.
- Members maintain alternate identities and carefully constructed covers used to infiltrate households, courts, and criminal dens. They are sworn to secrecy and to use their station for justice and protection.

Mechanical Details (5e)
- Skill Proficiencies: Performance, Insight (player may choose Persuasion or Deception instead of Insight if preferred)
- Tool Proficiencies: Disguise kit, Harp (musical instrument)
- Languages: One of your choice
- Equipment: Fine common clothes, disguise kit, a slim silver pin stamped with a crescent and a hidden mirror (society token), belt pouch with 10 gp, and a trinket from your mentor

Features
- Hidden Refuge: Once per settlement/region where the society operates, a member can request sanctuary or a small favor from other members: a safe room for a night, a sympathetic servant who can provide information, short-term lodging, or an introduction to a contact who can help with discreet needs. The GM decides specifics and frequency.

- Moonlit Persona: Once per long rest, with 10 minutes of preparation and appropriate clothing/props, you can assume a fully convincing false identity for up to 24 hours. You gain advantage on Performance or Deception checks to maintain the persona for the duration. High-stakes scrutiny (official investigations or intense scrutiny by a noble) still applies normally.

Roleplay Guidance
- Members are compassionate defenders: they place sheltering and protection above vengeance. They use their noble station and stagecraft to quietly rescue and provide for those in need.
- Suggested Bonds/Ideals/Flaws:
  - Ideal (Compassion): "We use our privilege to shelter those who cannot shelter themselves."
  - Bond: "I failed once to protect a child; I will not fail again."
  - Flaw: "I sometimes put others' safety before my own, endangering missions."

Sample Contacts & Hooks
- Madame Azra — an innkeeper and covert network contact who can hide people or pass messages.
- Lady Yara — a noble ally who supplies forged letters and covers for travel.
- Sister Imane — Sahar's trainer and moral anchor, now running a children's ward.

GM Notes
- This background is non-magical and balanced: it grants two skill proficiencies, two tool proficiencies (instrument + disguise kit), one language, and modest features useful for roleplay and low-frequency story mechanical benefits. The society's reach and favors are campaign-dependent and should be negotiated with the GM.
